				&emsp;&emsp;These are often labelled as 0 and 1.<br>

				<h2>Statistics</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;Binary data is a statistical data type
					consisting of categorical data that can take exactly two possible values,
					such as <b>"A"</b> and <b>"B"</b>, or <b>"heads"</b> and <b>"tails"</b>.
				</p><p>
					&emsp;&emsp;It is also called dichotomous data,
					and an older term is quantal data. The two values
					are often referred to generically as <b>"success"</b> and <b>"failure"</b>.
				</p><p>
					&emsp;&emsp;As a form of categorical data, binary data is nominal data,
					meaning the values are qualitatively different
					and cannot be compared numerically.
					However, the values are frequently represented as 1 or 0,
					which corresponds to counting the number of successes
					in a single trial: 1 <i>(success)</i> or 0 <i>(failure)</i>.

				<h2>Computer Science</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;In modern computers, binary data refers to
					any data represented in binary form rather than interpreted
					on a higher level or converted into some other form.
				</p><p>
					&emsp;&emsp;At the lowest level, bits are stored in a bistable device
					such as a flip-flop. While most binary data has symbolic meaning not
					all binary data is numeric. Some binary data corresponds
					to computer instructions, such as the data within processor registers
					decoded by the control unit along the <b>fetch-decode-execute</b> cycle.
					Computers rarely modify individual bits for performance reasons.
					Instead, data is aligned in groups of a fixed number of bits,
					usually 1 byte <i>(8 bits)</i>. Hence, <b>"binary data"</b> in computers are actually
					sequences of bytes.
				</p><p>
					&emsp;&emsp;On a higher level, data is accessed
					in groups of 1 word <i>(4 bytes)</i> for <b>32-bit</b> systems
					and 1 dword <i>(8 bytes)</i> for <b>64-bit</b> systems.
